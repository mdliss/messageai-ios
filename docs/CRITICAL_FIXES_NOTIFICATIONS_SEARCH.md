# Critical Fixes: Push Notifications & RAG Search

## Summary

Two critical issues affecting MessageAI have been fixed:
1. **Push notifications not working correctly** - notifications were only showing when app was in background, not when user was on different tabs/conversations
2. **RAG search accuracy poor** - search returned irrelevant results because it used pure vector similarity without keyword boosting

## Issue #1: Push Notifications Fixed ✅

### Root Cause
**File**: `messageAI/ViewModels/ConversationViewModel.swift` line 100

**Broken Logic**:
```swift
let shouldShowNotification = !isViewingConversation && !appStateService.isAppInForeground
```

This required BOTH conditions to be true:
- User NOT viewing conversation AND
- App NOT in foreground

**Problem**: This meant notifications ONLY appeared when app was in background. Even if user was on a different tab (Decisions, AI, Profile) or viewing a different conversation, no notification appeared because `isAppInForeground` was true.

### The Fix

**New Logic**:
```swift
let shouldShowNotification = !isInForeground || !isViewingConversation
```

**Translation**: Show notification if app is in background OR user is not viewing this specific conversation.

### Notification Behavior After Fix

✅ **Notifications SHOW when**:
- App is in background (always)
- App is in foreground viewing different conversation
- App is in foreground on Decisions tab
- App is in foreground on AI tab
- App is in foreground on Profile tab
- App is in foreground on Search tab

❌ **Notifications SKIP when**:
- User is actively viewing the conversation where the message arrived

### Enhanced Logging

Added comprehensive logging to track notification decisions:
```
📬 Message received in conversation: [ID]
   → Sender: [Name]
   → App state: FOREGROUND/BACKGROUND
   → Current conversation: [ID or none]
   → Viewing this conversation: YES/NO
   → Decision: SHOW NOTIFICATION ✅ or SKIP NOTIFICATION ❌
```

This makes debugging notification issues much easier.

### Testing the Fix

**Test Case 1: Background Notifications**
1. Open app, then background it (home button)
2. Send message from another device
3. ✅ Notification should appear on lock screen
4. Tap notification → app opens to conversation

**Test Case 2: Foreground Different Conversation**
1. Open app to Conversation A
2. Send message to Conversation B from another device
3. ✅ Notification should appear (banner)
4. Logs show: "SHOW NOTIFICATION ✅ - user viewing different screen"

**Test Case 3: Foreground Same Conversation**
1. Open app to Conversation A
2. Send message to Conversation A from another device
3. ❌ No notification (user already sees it)
4. Logs show: "SKIP NOTIFICATION ❌ - user actively viewing this conversation"

**Test Case 4: Different Tabs**
1. Open app, navigate to Decisions tab
2. Send message from another device
3. ✅ Notification should appear
4. Logs show: "SHOW NOTIFICATION ✅ - user viewing different screen"

## Issue #2: RAG Search Accuracy Improved ✅

### Root Cause
**File**: `functions/src/ai/ragSearch.ts`

**Problem**: Search used pure vector similarity (cosine similarity between embeddings) without any keyword boosting.

**Example Bad Result**:
- Query: "meeting"
- Result #1: "Notification" - 46% match (WRONG - no keyword)
- Result #2: "Notification" - 46% match (WRONG - no keyword)
- Result #3: "I will schedule the meeting" - 44% match (CORRECT but ranked #3)

Messages containing the actual search term ranked LOWER than irrelevant messages due to quirks in semantic embeddings.

### The Fix: Hybrid Search

Implemented **hybrid search** that combines:
1. **Vector similarity** (semantic search) - 60% weight
2. **Keyword matching** (exact/partial) - 40% weight

### Keyword Scoring Algorithm

```typescript
function calculateKeywordScore(messageText: string, query: string): number
```

**Scoring breakdown**:
- Exact full query match: +0.5
- Each exact word boundary match: +0.1 (up to 0.3)
- Each partial word match: +0.05
- Bonus for matching all query words: +0.2
- Maximum score: 1.0

**Examples**:
- "Let's have a meeting tomorrow" for query "meeting":
  - Exact word match: +0.1
  - Keyword score: 0.8 (80%)
  
- "The meetings are scheduled" for query "meeting":
  - Partial match: +0.05
  - Keyword score: 0.55 (55%)
  
- "Notification" for query "meeting":
  - No match
  - Keyword score: 0.0 (0%)

### Hybrid Scoring Formula

```typescript
const hybridScore = (vectorScore * 0.6) + (keywordScore * 0.4)
```

**60/40 split ensures**:
- Exact keyword matches rank high (keyword boost)
- Semantic matches still work (vector similarity preserved)
- Best of both worlds

### Enhanced Logging

Added detailed logging for search results:
```
📋 Top 5 matches:
   1. "Let's have a meeting tomorrow"
      Hybrid: 82.5% (Vector: 85.0%, Keyword: 80.0%)
   2. "Schedule the team meeting"
      Hybrid: 78.3% (Vector: 75.0%, Keyword: 85.0%)
   3. "Notification"
      Hybrid: 27.6% (Vector: 46.0%, Keyword: 0.0%)
```

This shows exactly why each message ranked where it did.

### Search Results After Fix

**For query "meeting"**:
- ✅ Messages containing "meeting" rank in top 3
- ✅ Partial matches like "meetings" rank high
- ✅ Semantic matches like "sync up" still work
- ❌ Irrelevant messages like "Notification" rank low or excluded

### API Response Changes

Added new fields to `SearchResult` interface:
```typescript
interface SearchResult {
  messageId: string;
  text: string;
  senderName: string;
  timestamp: string;
  score: number;           // Hybrid score (used for ranking)
  snippet: string;
  vectorScore?: number;    // Vector similarity component
  keywordScore?: number;   // Keyword match component
}
```

Clients can now see the breakdown of scores for debugging.

### Testing the Fix

**Test Case 1: Exact Keyword Match**
- Query: "meeting"
- Expected: Messages with "meeting" rank #1-3 with >70% scores
- Expected: "Notification" ranks last or not shown

**Test Case 2: Semantic Match**
- Query: "meeting"
- Expected: "Let's sync up" and "Let's have a call" rank higher than "Notification"
- Expected: Semantic matches work even without exact keyword

**Test Case 3: Partial Match**
- Query: "meeting"
- Expected: "The meetings are scheduled" ranks high
- Expected: Partial matches get keyword boost

**Test Case 4: Case Insensitive**
- Query: "meeting"
- Expected: "MEETING", "Meeting", "meeting" all rank equally high
- Expected: Case doesn't matter

**Test Case 5: Multiple Keywords**
- Query: "meeting tomorrow"
- Expected: Messages with both words rank #1
- Expected: Messages with one word rank lower

## Verification Commands

### Test Notifications
```bash
# Monitor logs while testing
# Send message to conversation while app is:
# 1. In background
# 2. In foreground viewing different conversation
# 3. In foreground on different tab
# Look for "SHOW NOTIFICATION ✅" in logs
```

### Test RAG Search
```bash
# Monitor Cloud Functions logs
firebase functions:log --only ragSearch

# Look for:
# - Hybrid score breakdown for each result
# - Keyword scores showing exact matches
# - Results sorted by hybrid score
```

### Deploy Verification
```bash
# Verify Cloud Function deployed
firebase functions:list | grep ragSearch

# Should show:
# ragSearch(us-central1): Deployed
```
