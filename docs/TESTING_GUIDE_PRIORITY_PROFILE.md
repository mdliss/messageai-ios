## Troubleshooting

### If Priority Navigation Doesn't Work:
- Check console for error logs
- Verify conversation exists in Firestore
- Verify message exists in conversation
- Check conversationId and messageId are correct
- Ensure message is actually in the loaded messages array

### If Display Name Doesn't Update:
- Check console for Firestore error
- Verify user is authenticated
- Check network connection
- Wait 3-5 seconds for sync (Firestore listeners)
- Check users collection in Firebase console

### If Avatar Doesn't Update:
- For built-in: Should be instant, check avatarType and avatarId in Firestore
- For custom: Check upload progress, verify Firebase Storage permissions
- Check console for upload errors
- Verify image compression succeeded
- Check storage.rules allow writes to users/{userId}/

### If Real-Time Sync Doesn't Work:
- Verify both users in same conversation
- Check Firestore listeners are active (check console logs)
- Wait up to 5 seconds for propagation
- Try pull-to-refresh on conversations list
- Verify Firestore rules allow reads

## Architecture Decisions

### Priority Messages Navigation

**Why This Approach:**
- ✅ Reuses existing NavigationStack pattern (DRY)
- ✅ Minimal changes to ChatView (just added optional parameter)
- ✅ No new navigation system needed (KISS)
- ✅ Loads conversation on-demand (performance)
- ✅ ScrollViewReader already exists in ChatView (DRY)
- ✅ Auto-fade highlight keeps UI clean (UX)

**Alternative Approaches Rejected:**
- ❌ Deep linking: Over-engineered for simple navigation
- ❌ Global navigation coordinator: Too complex for MVP
- ❌ Programmatic UIKit navigation: Not SwiftUI-native
- ❌ Permanent highlight: Clutters UI

### Profile Editing

**Why Built-in Avatars:**
- ✅ Instant selection (no upload delay)
- ✅ No network request to display (rendered client-side)
- ✅ No storage costs (SwiftUI shapes and SF Symbols)
- ✅ Consistent look across app
- ✅ Perfect for users who want quick personalization

**Why Support Custom Photos:**
- ✅ Full personalization for users who want it
- ✅ Firebase Storage already configured (DRY)
- ✅ Existing ImageCompressor utility (DRY)
- ✅ Common user expectation in messaging apps

**Why Two-Tier System:**
- ✅ Built-in: Instant, no permissions, no upload
- ✅ Custom: Full control, personal branding
- ✅ Users can choose what fits their needs
- ✅ Both use same Firestore sync mechanism (DRY)

**Alternative Approaches Rejected:**
- ❌ Custom photos only: Requires upload for every user
- ❌ Built-in only: Limited personalization
- ❌ Camera access: Adds complexity, most users prefer library
- ❌ Image cropping UI: Over-engineered for MVP
- ❌ Avatar generation (Gravatar, etc.): External dependency

## How Real-Time Sync Works

### Data Flow

**Step 1: User Updates Profile**
```
ProfileView → ProfileEditingViewModel → Firestore
```

**Step 2: Firestore Documents Updated**
```
users/{userId}
  - displayName: "Sarah Chen"
  - avatarType: "built_in"
  - avatarId: "blue_purple_gradient"

conversations/{conv-id}
  - participantDetails.{userId}.displayName: "Sarah Chen"
  - participantDetails.{userId}.photoURL: [deleted for built-in]
```

**Step 3: Firestore Listeners Fire**
```
AuthViewModel listener → Updates currentUser
ConversationViewModel listener → Updates conversation.participantDetails
ChatViewModel listener → Updates message.senderName (if needed)
```

**Step 4: SwiftUI Re-renders**
```
@Published properties change → SwiftUI detects → Views re-render
```

**Total Time: 2-3 seconds** for other users to see updates

### Why No Manual Refresh Needed

The app already has Firestore listeners set up in:
- `AuthViewModel.setupAuthStateListener()` - Listens to auth state and user document
- `ConversationViewModel.loadConversations()` - Listens to all user's conversations
- `ChatViewModel.loadMessages()` - Listens to messages in conversation

When ProfileEditingViewModel updates Firestore, these listeners automatically fire and update the UI. No manual refresh, reload, or auth state reset needed. This is the KISS approach - rely on existing real-time infrastructure.
