## Root Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: User Model Serialization ✅
**Problem:** `User.toDictionary()` and `CodingKeys` didn't include `avatarType` and `avatarId`  
**Fix:** Added both fields to serialization and deserialization  
**Result:** Built-in avatar selections now persist to Firestore

### Issue 2: Missing Avatar Information in Messages ✅
**Problem:** Message model only had `senderPhotoURL`, missing avatar type and ID  
**Fix:** Added `senderAvatarType` and `senderAvatarId` fields  
**Result:** Messages carry complete avatar information

### Issue 3: Chat Message Avatar Rendering ✅
**Problem:** MessageBubbleView only checked `photoURL`, couldn't render built-in avatars  
**Fix:** Replaced with UserAvatarView component that handles all types  
**Result:** Built-in avatars finally display in message bubbles

### Issue 4: Conversation List Avatar Rendering ✅
**Problem:** ConversationRowView only checked `photoURL`  
**Fix:** Replaced with UserAvatarView component  
**Result:** Built-in avatars display in conversations list

### Issue 5: Message Creation Missing Avatar Data ✅
**Problem:** ChatView only passed `photoURL` when creating messages  
**Fix:** Updated to pass `avatarType` and `avatarId` from participant  
**Result:** New messages include complete avatar information

### Issue 6: Conversation Creation Missing Avatar Data ✅
**Problem:** FirestoreService only used `photoURL` for ParticipantDetail  
**Fix:** Updated to include `avatarType` and `avatarId`  
**Result:** New conversations have complete participant avatar data

### Issue 7: Profile Not Updating in Real-Time ✅
**Problem:** ProfileView didn't listen to Firestore changes  
**Fix:** Added Firestore snapshot listener  
**Result:** Profile updates immediately when data changes

## Data Flow (After Implementation)

### Built-in Avatar Selection Flow
```
User selects built-in avatar in AvatarSelectionView
    ↓
ProfileEditingViewModel.updateProfilePicture() called
    ↓
Firestore users/{userId} updated with:
  - avatarType: "built_in"
  - avatarId: "blue_circle"
    ↓
Firestore conversations/{convId} updated with:
  - participantDetails.{userId}.avatarType: "built_in"
  - participantDetails.{userId}.avatarId: "blue_circle"
  - participantDetails.{userId}.photoURL: DELETED
    ↓
ProfileView snapshot listener fires
    ↓
authViewModel.currentUser updated
    ↓
Profile UI refreshes immediately showing blue circle
    ↓
User sends message
    ↓
Message created with senderAvatarType and senderAvatarId
    ↓
MessageBubbleView renders using UserAvatarView
    ↓
UserAvatarView checks avatarType = .builtIn
    ↓
Looks up BuiltInAvatar for "blue_circle"
    ↓
Renders BuiltInAvatarView with blue circle
    ✅ Blue circle avatar displays in message bubble!
```

### Display Name Change Flow
```
User edits name in ProfileView
    ↓
ProfileEditingViewModel.updateDisplayName() called
    ↓
Firestore users/{userId}.displayName updated to "Sarah Chen"
    ↓
Firestore conversations/{convId}.participantDetails.{userId}.displayName updated
    ↓
ProfileView snapshot listener fires
    ↓
authViewModel.currentUser.displayName = "Sarah Chen"
    ↓
Profile UI refreshes immediately
    ✅ Name persists when navigating away and back!
```

## Code Quality Improvements

### DRY Principle Achievement
**Before:** Avatar rendering logic duplicated across 6 files (150+ lines total)  
**After:** Single UserAvatarView component (70 lines), used everywhere (reduces duplication by ~80%)

### KISS Principle Achievement
**Before:** Complex conditional logic in every view checking photoURL, rendering AsyncImage with placeholders  
**After:** Simple `UserAvatarView(user: user)` call everywhere

### Centralized Logic
- **Before:** Each view had its own avatar rendering logic
- **After:** UserAvatarView is single source of truth
- **Benefit:** Future avatar changes only need to update one file

   - Verify updates appear on others within 2-3 seconds

### If Issues Found:

- Check Firestore console for actual data being written
- Check Xcode console logs for debug output (extensive logging added)
