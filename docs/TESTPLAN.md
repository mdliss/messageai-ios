## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Gaps
1. **Smart Search**: Not implemented (AI-powered semantic search)
2. **Action Items CRUD**: Limited UI for managing extracted tasks
3. **Google Sign-In**: Disabled due to simulator OAuth issues

### Workarounds
- Smart Search: Users can use native iOS search (Cmd+F) for keyword matching
- Action Items: Display extracted items as insights, manual copy to external task tracker
- Google Sign-In: Email/password auth works perfectly, covers core functionality

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: None (all critical features working)
- **Medium Risk**: Action Items UI could be more robust
- **Low Risk**: Smart Search missing (nice-to-have for persona)
