## 🎯 Features Implemented

### Feature 1: Manual Poll Confirmation

**What**: Poll creators can manually confirm or cancel polls instead of auto-finalization.

**Why**: Gives creators control over timing, allows partial voting, enables tiebreaking.

**Implementation**:
- Data model: Added pollStatus, confirmedBy, confirmedAt fields
- UI: Green "Confirm" + Red "Cancel" buttons (creator only)
- Backend: Removed auto-finalization when all vote
- Logic: confirmPoll() and cancelPoll() functions

**Files Changed**: 4 files (~250 lines)

### Feature 2: Decision Persistence (Bug Fix #1)

**What**: Decisions persist in Decisions tab after navigating away and returning.

**Why**: Previously, decisions disappeared due to duplicate listener issues.

**Implementation**:
- Added cleanup() call before creating new listeners
- Prevents listener duplication
- Ensures clean state on every navigation

**Files Changed**: 1 file (1 line added + logging)

### Feature 3: Dismissal Independence (Bug Fix #2)

**What**: Dismissing decision notifications in chat does NOT remove decisions from Decisions tab.

**Why**: Decisions tab is permanent record, notifications are temporary alerts.

**Implementation**:
- Removed dismissed filter from Decisions tab query
- Chat continues filtering by dismissed
- Clean separation of concerns

**Files Changed**: 2 files (1 line removed + logging)

## 🔍 Root Causes and Fixes

### Bug #1: Duplicate Listeners

**Symptom**: Decisions disappeared after navigation

**Root Cause**:
```
Navigate to Decisions → Create Listener #1
Navigate away (listener stays attached)
Navigate back → Create Listener #2 (duplicate!)
Multiple listeners → State conflicts → Data loss
```

**Fix**:
```swift
func loadDecisions(userId: String) {
    cleanup()  // ← Remove old listeners FIRST
    // ... create new listeners
}
```

**Result**: Only 1 listener at a time, no duplicates, persistent data ✅

### Bug #2: Incorrect Query Filter

**Symptom**: Clicking X on notification removed decision from Decisions tab

**Root Cause**:
```
X button → dismissed=true
Chat query → WHERE dismissed==false (✅ correct)
Decisions query → WHERE dismissed==false (❌ wrong)
Result → Decision filtered out from both views
```

**Fix**:
```swift
// Decisions tab query (DecisionsViewModel.swift)
.whereField("type", isEqualTo: "decision")
// Removed: .whereField("dismissed", isEqualTo: false)
```

**Result**: Chat filters dismissed, Decisions shows all ✅

## 🎯 How Everything Works Together

### Complete User Journey

**1. Poll Creation**
- User asks "When can we meet?"
- AI creates poll with 3 options
- Poll appears in Decisions tab for all participants

**2. Voting**
- Users vote in Decisions tab
- Real-time sync updates vote counts
- AI acknowledges each vote

**3. Manual Confirmation (Feature 1)**
- Creator sees Confirm/Cancel buttons ✅
- Participants see "waiting for creator..." ✅
- Creator confirms → Two Firestore operations:
  - Update poll: pollStatus="confirmed"
  - Create decision: new document with pollId link

**4. Notification Dismissal (Bug #2 Fixed)**
- Decision notification appears in chat
- User clicks X → dismissed=true
- Chat filters it out (notification disappears) ✅
- Decisions tab ignores dismissal (decision persists) ✅

**5. Navigation Persistence (Bug #1 Fixed)**
- User navigates away from Decisions tab
- cleanup() removes old listeners
- User navigates back
- loadDecisions() creates new listener
- Query executes (NO dismissed filter)
- Decisions appear ✅

**Result**: Reliable, persistent, user-controlled decision tracking! 🎉

## 💡 Key Technical Insights

### 1. Listener Lifecycle is Critical
SwiftUI doesn't auto-cleanup listeners on unmount. Must explicitly cleanup to prevent memory leaks and duplicate listeners.

### 2. One Filter Doesn't Fit All
Same data can serve multiple purposes (temporary notifications vs permanent records). Use different query filters for different views.

### 3. Logging is Essential
Comprehensive logging makes root cause analysis trivial. Invested 180 lines in logging, saved hours in debugging.

### 4. KISS Wins
Complex problems often have simple solutions. Both fixes were 1-line changes. Don't overthink.
