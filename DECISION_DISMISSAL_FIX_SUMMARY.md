# Decision Dismissal Bug - FIXED ✅

## 🚨 Critical Bug Fixed

**Problem**: Clicking X to dismiss decision notifications in chat removed decisions from Decisions tab permanently.

**Fix**: Removed dismissed filter from Decisions tab query (1 line change).

---

## 🔍 Root Cause

**The Bug:**
```swift
// Chat: aiViewModel.dismissInsight() sets dismissed=true ✅ Correct
// Decisions tab: queries WHERE dismissed==false ❌ Wrong - filters out decisions!
```

**Why it broke:**
- Same `dismissed` flag used for both chat notifications and Decisions tab
- Chat should filter by dismissed (temporary notifications)
- Decisions tab should NOT filter by dismissed (permanent record)
- Both were filtering by dismissed, causing decisions to disappear

---

## ✅ The Fix

### File Modified
`messageAI/ViewModels/DecisionsViewModel.swift`

### Change Made (Line 65)

**BEFORE:**
```swift
.whereField("dismissed", isEqualTo: false)  // ← REMOVED THIS LINE
```

**AFTER:**
```swift
// No dismissed filter - Decisions tab shows all confirmed decisions
```

**Impact**: Decisions tab now shows ALL decisions regardless of dismissal status.

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Notification Dismissal Flow

**When user clicks X:**
1. `aiViewModel.dismissInsight()` called
2. Firestore updated: `dismissed = true`
3. **Chat query** filters by `dismissed==false`
   - Notification disappears from chat ✅
4. **Decisions query** does NOT filter by dismissed
   - Decision persists in Decisions tab ✅

**Result**: Clean separation between temporary notifications and permanent decisions.

## 📊 Testing Instructions

### Quick 1-Minute Test

1. **Confirm a poll** (any simulator)
2. **Navigate to chat** - see decision notification with X button
3. **Click X** - notification disappears from chat
4. **Navigate to Decisions tab** - decision is STILL THERE ✅
5. **Navigate away and back** - decision PERSISTS ✅

**If decision persists after dismissing notification, bug is FIXED!** 🎉

✅ Insight dismissed
   Notification removed from chat view
   Decision still exists in Firestore
   Decisions tab will continue showing this decision (permanent record)
```

### When Decisions Tab Loads
```
Query: conversations/[id]/insights where type='decision' (NO dismissed filter)
