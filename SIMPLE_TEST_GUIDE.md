## 🎯 Your 3 Simulators Are Ready

All running the updated app with **BOTH bug fixes** applied.

---

## ✅ Quick Test (2 Minutes Total)

### Step 1: Create and Confirm a Poll (30 seconds)

**On any simulator:**
1. Open or create a group chat with 3 users
2. Type: "When can we meet?"
3. Click "yes, help me" when AI suggests
4. Tap **Decisions** tab at bottom
5. Click **"Confirm Decision"** button (green)
6. Wait for confirmation to complete

**Expected**: Decision appears in Decisions tab ✅

---

### Step 2: Test Navigation Persistence - BUG #1 FIX (30 seconds)

**On the same simulator:**
1. While on Decisions tab, note the decision is there
2. Tap **Chats** tab at bottom
3. Wait 2 seconds
4. Tap **Decisions** tab at bottom again

**CRITICAL CHECK**: Is the decision STILL there? 

- **YES** → Bug #1 FIXED! ✅
- **NO** → Bug #1 NOT fixed (check console logs)

Repeat 2 more times (Decisions → Chats → Decisions) to confirm.

---

### Step 3: Test Dismissal Independence - BUG #2 FIX (30 seconds)

**On the same simulator:**
1. Navigate to the **group chat** where you confirmed the poll
2. Look for decision notification card (floating at bottom)
3. Click the **X button** on the notification card
4. Notification should disappear from chat
5. Navigate to **Decisions** tab

**CRITICAL CHECK**: Is the decision STILL there?

- **YES** → Bug #2 FIXED! ✅
- **NO** → Bug #2 NOT fixed (check console logs)

---

### Step 4: Combined Test (30 seconds)

**Final validation:**
1. With notification dismissed, navigate: Decisions → Chats → Decisions
2. Navigate: Decisions → Profile → Decisions
3. Navigate: Decisions → AI → Decisions

**CRITICAL CHECK**: Does decision persist through all navigations?

- **YES** → BOTH bugs FIXED! 🎉
- **NO** → Check which navigation breaks it

---

## 🎬 What You Should See

### In Chat (After Dismissal)
- ❌ No decision notification cards (dismissed)
- ✅ Regular messages still visible
- ✅ Can send new messages

### In Decisions Tab (After Dismissal)
- ✅ Confirmed poll with green "meeting scheduled ✓" header
- ✅ Decision entry with "meeting scheduled: [time]"
- ✅ Vote counts and results visible
- ✅ Timestamp shows when created
- ✅ **Nothing disappears** regardless of dismissals or navigation

---

## 📊 Console Logs (Quick Check)

### Open Console (Xcode or Terminal)

**Look for these key lines:**

**After confirming poll:**
```
✅ Decision entry created successfully!
```

**After navigating back to Decisions:**
```
📊 Total decisions now: 2
```

**After dismissing notification:**
```
⚠️  Decision will PERSIST in Decisions tab
```

**If you see all 3 lines, BOTH fixes are working!** ✅

---

## 🚨 Red Flags (Issues)

### Bug #1 NOT Fixed
**Symptom**: "Total decisions now: 0" after navigation  
**Action**: Share console logs with me

### Bug #2 NOT Fixed
**Symptom**: Decision disappears immediately after clicking X  
**Action**: Check if dismissal logged, share console logs

### Both Working Partially
**Symptom**: One fix works, other doesn't  
**Action**: Note which works, share specific failure scenario

---

## 🎉 Success!

**If decision persists through:**
- ✅ Multiple navigations (Bug #1 fixed)
- ✅ Notification dismissal (Bug #2 fixed)
- ✅ Combined navigations + dismissals (Both fixed)

**Then BOTH BUGS ARE COMPLETELY FIXED!** 🎉
