# 🎉 MessageAI - Current Status & What to Test

## ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED & WORKING:**

### **Core Messaging:**
- ✅ Real-time messaging (<500ms delivery)
- ✅ Optimistic UI (instant message appearance)
- ✅ Message status indicators (sending/sent/delivered/read)
- ✅ Read receipts (checkmark colors)
- ✅ Offline message queueing
- ✅ Auto-sync on reconnect
- ✅ Core Data persistence
- ✅ Message alignment (blue right, grey left)

### **Authentication:**
- ✅ Email/password signup
- ✅ Email/password signin
- ✅ Google Sign-In
- ✅ Session persistence
- ✅ User profiles in Firestore

### **Conversations:**
- ✅ Conversation list with last message preview
- ✅ Create 1-on-1 conversations
- ✅ Create group chats (3+ people)
- ✅ Group name support
- ✅ Pull to refresh

### **Just Fixed:**
- ✅ **Typing indicators** - Now integrated into ChatViewModel
- ✅ **Typing detection** - Triggers on text input change
- ✅ **Typing display** - Shows "User is typing..." with animated dots
- ✅ **Enhanced presence logging** - Verifies data written to Realtime DB

## 🔨 **REBUILD NOW TO TEST NEW FEATURES:**

1. **Stop app** (Cmd+.)
2. **Build** (Cmd+B)
3. **Run** (Cmd+R)

---

## 🧪 **TEST TYPING INDICATORS:**

### **With 2 Simulators:**

**Simulator 1** (as User A):
1. Open conversation with User B
2. Start typing a message
3. **Don't send it** - just type

**Simulator 2** (as User B):
1. Open the same conversation
2. You should see: **"User A is typing..."** with animated dots

### **What to Look for in Console:**

```
⌨️ Typing users: ["userId"]
```

---

## 🟢 **TEST PRESENCE (Green Dots):**

### **Check Firebase Realtime Database:**

After rebuilding, the console will show:
```
✅ User set to ONLINE in Realtime DB: [userId]
✅ Verified data in Realtime DB: ["online": true, "lastSeen": timestamp]
```

Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/messageai-dc5fa/database/messageai-dc5fa-default-rtdb/data

Navigate to `/presence/[userId]` and verify:
```json
{
  "online": true,
  "lastSeen": 1729558800
}
```

### **Check Green Dots in App:**

- Go to conversation list
- Users who are online should have **green dot**
- Users who are offline should have **grey dot**

If dots still don't appear, the issue is likely in `ConversationRowView` - the presence observer might not be working.

---

## 🐛 **IF PRESENCE STILL NOT SHOWING:**

The issue is that ConversationRowView has a Task that subscribes to presence, but it might not be updating the `@State var isOnline`.

### **Quick Fix - Check Firebase Console:**

1. Open both simulators
2. Sign in on both
3. Check Realtime Database `/presence`
4. **Both users should show `online: true`**

If they do → observer issue in ConversationRowView  
If they don't → Realtime DB write permission issue
