# 🧪 Test Enhanced AI Persona

## ✅ **READY TO TEST**

Both simulators running with enhanced AI deployed!

---

## 🤖 **Option B: Proactive Assistant - LIVE**

I implemented **Option B** from your image because:
1. Foundation already existed (`detectProactiveSuggestions`)
2. Simpler than autonomous agent (Option A)
3. Immediate value for remote teams

---

## 🚀 **What's New**

### **Enhanced Proactive Scheduling** ⭐
**Before**: "Would you like help finding a time?"  
**Now**: Suggests 2-3 specific meeting times!

**Example**:
```
User: "When can we schedule the design review?"

AI Response (automatic):
