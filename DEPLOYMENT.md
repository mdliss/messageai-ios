## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
1. Clean build folder (Shift+Cmd+K)
2. Delete DerivedData
3. Restart Xcode
4. Check all files in target membership

### Push Notifications Don't Work
- Must test on physical device
- Check APNs certificate in Firebase
- Verify capabilities enabled in Xcode
- Check FCM token is being saved

### Cloud Functions Fail
- Check logs: `firebase functions:log`
- Verify Anthropic API key set
- Check function deploy status in console
- Test with emulator first

### Firestore Permission Denied
- Deploy rules: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
- Check user is authenticated
- Verify participantIds includes user

---

## Cost Monitoring

### Firebase Free Tier Limits
- Firestore: 50k reads/day, 20k writes/day
- Storage: 5GB, 1GB downloads/day
- Functions: 125k invocations/day
- Realtime DB: 100 simultaneous connections

### Set Budget Alerts
1. Firebase Console â†’ Usage and billing
2. Set budget: $10
3. Get email alerts at 50%, 90%, 100%

### Optimize Costs
- Use Core Data caching aggressively
- Limit Firestore queries
- Use Realtime DB for ephemeral data
- Compress images before upload
