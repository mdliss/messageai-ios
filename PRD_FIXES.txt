# AI Features Fixes - Product Requirements Document

## Current State Analysis

### what's been implemented (code complete):

**all three advanced ai features are FULLY CODED:**
- ✅ smart response suggestions (models, viewmodels, views, cloud functions)
- ✅ proactive blocker detection (models, viewmodels, views, cloud functions, triggers)
- ✅ team sentiment analysis (models, viewmodels, views, cloud functions, triggers, scheduled jobs)
- ✅ unified ai dashboard (complete view showing all features)
- ✅ ai features settings panel (toggles, privacy, about pages)

**navigation partially working:**
- ✅ ai features settings accessible from profile → ai features
- ✅ blocker dashboard accessible from ai assistant → team blockers → blocker dashboard
- ✅ unified dashboard accessible from ai assistant → unified ai dashboard
- ❌ ai tab goes to intermediate "ai assistant" page (should skip directly to dashboard)

**what's NOT working:**
- ❌ response suggestions: code integrated but cloud function not deployed (shows "0 available")
- ❌ team sentiment: code complete but cloud functions not deployed (shows hardcoded "neutral")
- ❌ team blockers: code complete but cloud functions not deployed (shows "0 active", untested if actually working)
- ❌ existing ai features section: has misleading arrows suggesting they're tappable (they're not)
- ❌ settings toggles: ui exists but not connected to actually disable features

### why features aren't working:

**root cause: cloud functions not deployed to firebase**

all three features require backend cloud functions:
1. **response suggestions** needs: `generateResponseSuggestions` (https callable)
2. **blocker detection** needs: `detectBlocker` (https callable) + `onMessageCreatedCheckBlocker` (firestore trigger)
3. **sentiment analysis** needs: `analyzeSentiment` (https callable) + `onMessageCreatedAnalyzeSentiment` (firestore trigger) + `calculateSentimentAggregates` (scheduled function)

**evidence:**
- functions exist in code: `functions/src/ai/responseSuggestions.ts`, `blockerDetection.ts`, `sentiment.ts`
- functions exported in `functions/src/index.ts`
- typescript compiles successfully
- but `firebase deploy --only functions` has NOT been run
- firebase project doesn't have these functions deployed
- app tries to call non-existent functions, fails silently

**response suggestions specifically:**
- chatview.swift has monitoring logic (line 392-408 in ChatView.swift)
- `.onChange(of: viewModel.messages.count)` watches for new messages
- calls `shouldGenerateSuggestions(for:)` to check if message needs response
- calls `generateSuggestionsFor(message:)` which calls cloud function
- cloud function doesn't exist in firebase yet, so call fails
- error is caught and suppressed (graceful failure)
- suggestions never appear, count stays at 0

**team sentiment specifically:**
- trigger `onMessageCreatedAnalyzeSentiment` should run on every new text message
- trigger doesn't exist in firebase yet
- messages are sent/received but never analyzed
- no sentiment scores calculated or stored
- unified dashboard shows hardcoded 0.0 sentiment (displays as "neutral")
- scheduled function `calculateSentimentAggregates` doesn't exist, so no aggregates calculated

**team blockers specifically:**
- trigger `onMessageCreatedCheckBlocker` should run on new messages with blocker keywords
- trigger doesn't exist in firebase yet
- blocker messages are sent but never detected
- blocker count stays at 0
- blocker dashboard shows empty state (which is correct behavior for 0 blockers)

## Problems to Fix

### problem 1: navigation goes to intermediate page

**current behavior:**
- user taps ai button (sparkle icon in tab bar)
- navigates to AIAssistantView
- shows "ai assistant" page with list of features
- user must tap "unified ai dashboard" to see actual dashboard
- extra unnecessary step

**why it's a problem:**
- confusing ux (why have two ai pages?)
- wasted tap (users have to click twice)
- the intermediate page adds no value
- unified dashboard is much better, should be default

**what should happen:**
- user taps ai button
- IMMEDIATELY sees unified ai dashboard
- skip aiassistantview entirely
- direct, clean navigation

**technical cause:**
- `AuthContainerView.swift` line 44: `AIAssistantView()` is the ai tab destination
- should be: `UnifiedAIDashboardView(currentUserId: userId)`
- aiassistantview can be deprecated or removed

### problem 2: response suggestions not working

**current behavior:**
- unified dashboard shows "response suggestions: 0 available"
- section is not tappable (just informational)
- no suggestions ever generated
- feature appears to exist but doesn't work

**why it's a problem:**
- feature promises to save 30-45 minutes per day
- users expect suggestions to appear automatically
- completely non-functional despite ui being there
- misleading (shows feature exists but does nothing)

**what should happen:**
- messages ending with "?" or containing request keywords trigger suggestion generation
- gpt-4o generates 3-4 contextual reply options
- suggestions stored in database with message
- count updates: "3 available" instead of "0 available"
- tapping section shows list of messages with suggestions
- or opens view where suggestions can be used
- or navigates to conversations with pending suggestions

**technical cause:**
- monitoring logic EXISTS in ChatView.swift (lines 392-408)
- generation logic EXISTS in ResponseSuggestionsViewModel.swift
- cloud function EXISTS in responseSuggestions.ts
- BUT cloud function NOT DEPLOYED to firebase
- app calls non-existent function, fails gracefully
- error suppressed, user sees nothing

**what needs to happen:**
1. deploy cloud function: `firebase deploy --only functions:generateResponseSuggestions`
2. test: send message ending with "?"
3. verify suggestions generated and count updates
4. make section tappable to view/use suggestions

### problem 3: team sentiment not working

**current behavior:**
- unified dashboard shows "team sentiment: neutral"
- section is not tappable or shows vague text "view sentiment in group chat menus"
- no actual sentiment analysis happening
- always shows neutral regardless of messages

**why it's a problem:**
- feature promises to spot morale issues 2-3 days early
- users expect real sentiment data
- completely non-functional
- shows hardcoded value instead of calculated sentiment

**what should happen:**
- every text message gets sentiment analyzed automatically
- gpt-4o classifies sentiment: -1.0 (very negative) to +1.0 (very positive)
- hourly job calculates team and individual aggregates
- dashboard shows actual calculated sentiment with trend
- tapping section opens sentiment dashboard with:
  - team sentiment graph
  - individual member sentiments
  - messages contributing to sentiment
  - actionable insights

**technical cause:**
- sentiment analysis logic EXISTS in sentiment.ts
- trigger `onMessageCreatedAnalyzeSentiment` EXISTS
- scheduled function `calculateSentimentAggregates` EXISTS
- BUT none deployed to firebase
- messages arrive but never analyzed
- unified dashboard shows hardcoded 0.0 (displays as "neutral")

**what needs to happen:**
1. deploy functions: `firebase deploy --only functions:analyzeSentiment,onMessageCreatedAnalyzeSentiment,calculateSentimentAggregates`
2. messages will be analyzed automatically
3. wait for hourly aggregate or manually trigger
4. dashboard will show real sentiment data
5. add navigation to sentiment dashboard (needs conversationId)

### problem 4: team blockers unclear if working

**current behavior:**
- unified dashboard shows "team blockers: 0 active"
- section IS tappable (goes to blocker dashboard)
- blocker dashboard shows empty state
- unclear if detection is working or just no blockers exist

**why it's unclear:**
- no test data to verify detection works
- functions not deployed so detection can't happen
- empty state is correct behavior if no blockers
- but also correct if detection not running

**what should happen:**
- messages with blocker keywords ("i'm blocked on", "stuck on", "waiting for") trigger detection
- gpt-4o analyzes if person is actually blocked
- classifies severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- stores blocker in database
- count updates: "3 active" instead of "0 active"
- blocker dashboard shows detected blockers with details
- manager can mark resolved, snooze, or false positive

**technical cause:**
- blocker detection logic EXISTS in blockerDetection.ts
- trigger `onMessageCreatedCheckBlocker` EXISTS
- BUT not deployed to firebase
- blocker messages sent but never detected
- count correctly shows 0 (no blockers in database)

**what needs to happen:**
1. deploy functions: `firebase deploy --only functions:detectBlocker,onMessageCreatedCheckBlocker`
2. send test blocker message: "i'm blocked on the api integration"
3. verify detection happens
4. verify blocker appears in dashboard
5. verify count updates

### problem 5: existing ai features have misleading arrows

**current behavior:**
- unified dashboard shows "existing ai features" section at bottom
- lists: priority messages, action items, thread summaries, smart search, decision tracking
- each item has right-pointing chevron arrow
- arrows suggest items are tappable/interactive
- but clicking does nothing (they're just informational)

**why it's a problem:**
- misleading ui (arrows suggest interactivity)
- users will tap and expect something to happen
- creates confusion and frustration
- these features exist throughout the app, not as separate pages

**what should happen:**
- remove chevron arrows from all existing feature items
- items should be clearly informational only
- no interactive elements
- clean list showing features that exist in the app
- users access these features in their normal locations

**technical cause:**
- unified dashboard uses `DashboardCardView` for all items
- `DashboardCardView` always shows chevron arrow
- no variant without arrow
- items wrapped in non-functional containers

**what needs to happen:**
1. modify `DashboardCardView` to have optional `showChevron` parameter
2. or create separate `InfoCardView` without chevron
3. use non-chevron variant for existing features section
4. ensure items are not tappable

### problem 6: settings toggles don't control features

**current behavior:**
- settings panel shows toggles for all three features
- toggles can be turned on/off
- state is saved to @appstorage
- but toggling off a feature doesn't actually stop it

**why it's a problem:**
- toggles appear to work but have no effect
- misleading users (they think they're controlling features)
- privacy concern (users can't actually opt out)
- features should respect user preferences

**what should happen:**
- when response suggestions toggle is off:
  - stop monitoring messages for suggestions
  - don't generate suggestions
  - don't show suggestion count or section
- when team sentiment toggle is off:
  - stop analyzing messages (on device side)
  - don't show sentiment data
  - hide sentiment section
- when team blockers toggle is off:
  - stop checking for blockers (on device side)
  - don't show blocker count
  - hide blockers section

**technical cause:**
- toggles save to @appstorage successfully
- but code doesn't check @appstorage before running features
- chatview generates suggestions regardless of toggle
- dashboard shows all features regardless of toggles
- no conditional logic based on settings

**what needs to happen:**
1. read @appstorage values in viewmodels and views
2. check if feature enabled before running logic
3. conditionally show/hide dashboard sections based on toggles
4. respect user preferences throughout app

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### fix 1: change ai tab navigation

**file to modify:** `messageAI/Views/Auth/AuthContainerView.swift`

**current code (line 43-47):**
```swift
// AI Assistant tab (placeholder for PR #20B)
AIAssistantView()
    .tabItem {
        Label("ai", systemImage: "sparkles")
    }
```

**change to:**
```swift
// AI Dashboard tab - unified view of all AI insights
UnifiedAIDashboardView(currentUserId: authViewModel.currentUser?.id ?? "")
    .tabItem {
        Label("ai", systemImage: "sparkles")
    }
```

**note:** need access to currentUserId in AuthContainerView
- aiassistantview uses @environmentobject authviewmodel
- unifiedaidashboardview requires currentUserId parameter
- solution: pass authViewModel.currentUser?.id ?? ""

### fix 2: deploy cloud functions (enables all features)

**commands:**
```bash
cd functions
npm install
npm run build
firebase deploy --only functions
```

**what this deploys:**
- generateResponseSuggestions (for response suggestions)
- detectBlocker + onMessageCreatedCheckBlocker (for blocker detection)
- analyzeSentiment + onMessageCreatedAnalyzeSentiment + calculateSentimentAggregates (for sentiment analysis)

**verification:**
- check firebase console → functions tab
- all 6 new functions should show green status
- check logs for initialization messages

### fix 3: make response suggestions section functional

**after deployment, response suggestions will auto-generate**

**additional work needed:**
- make response suggestions section in unified dashboard tappable
- should navigate to view showing messages with suggestions
- or show list of suggestions to use

**file to modify:** `UnifiedAIDashboardView.swift`

**change response suggestions card from info-only to navigationlink:**
- current: just displays count
- new: tap opens ResponseSuggestionsListView (new view showing all available suggestions)

### fix 4: make team sentiment section functional

**after deployment, sentiment will analyze automatically**

**additional work needed:**
- calculate actual sentiment for display (not hardcoded 0.0)
- make section tappable to open sentiment dashboard

**challenge:** sentiment dashboard requires conversationId
- can't open generic sentiment dashboard
- need to either:
  - pick a "primary" team conversation
  - let user select which team to view
  - show aggregate across all teams

**simpler solution for now:**
- show aggregate sentiment across all user's conversations
- or just make it informational with instructions

### fix 5: remove arrows from existing features

**file to modify:** `UnifiedAIDashboardView.swift`

**current:** all items use `DashboardCardView` which includes chevron

**options:**
1. add `showChevron: Bool = true` parameter to dashboardcardview
2. create separate `InfoCardView` without chevron
3. modify existing items to not show chevron

**recommended:** option 1 (add optional parameter)

### fix 6: connect settings toggles to features

**files to modify:**
- chatview.swift (check toggle before generating suggestions)
- unifiedaidashboardview.swift (hide sections if disabled)
- viewmodels (check toggle before running)

**implementation:**
```swift
@appstorage("responsesuggestionsEnabled") var suggestionsEnabled = true

// in chatview
if suggestionsEnabled && shouldGenerateSuggestions(for: lastMessage) {
    generateSuggestionsFor(message: lastMessage)
}

// in unified dashboard
if suggestionsEnabled {
    // show response suggestions section
}
```

## Implementation Priority

### critical (required for any features to work):

**1. deploy cloud functions**
- blocks all three features from working
- 5-10 minutes to deploy
- must happen first

**2. deploy firestore indexes** (already done ✅)
- indexes needed for blocker queries
- completed in previous step

### high priority (improves ux significantly):

**3. fix ai tab navigation**
- change to go directly to unified dashboard
- skip intermediate ai assistant page
- quick fix (5 lines of code)

**4. remove arrows from existing features**
- eliminates misleading ui
- quick fix (add parameter to component)

### medium priority (adds functionality):

**5. connect settings toggles**
- makes toggles actually control features
- important for privacy and user control
- moderate complexity (check toggles in multiple places)

**6. make response suggestions section tappable**
- currently just shows count
- should navigate to suggestions list view
- requires creating new view or reusing existing

**7. make team sentiment section tappable**
- currently just shows "neutral"
- should open sentiment dashboard
- requires conversation selection or aggregation

### low priority (nice to have):

**8. real-time count updates**
- currently shows 0s because no data yet
- after deployment, counts should update automatically
- may require additional query logic

- wait 2-3 seconds
- check unified dashboard: should show "1 available" or "3 available"
- suggestions should be generated and stored

**test 2: team sentiment**
- send emotional messages: "this is so frustrating 😤"
- wait for analysis (few seconds)
- check if message has sentimentScore in database
- wait for hourly aggregate or manually trigger
- check unified dashboard: should show calculated sentiment

**test 3: team blockers**
- send: "i'm blocked on the api integration, waiting for credentials"
- wait for detection (few seconds)
- check unified dashboard: should show "1 active"
- open blocker dashboard: should show detected blocker

### after navigation fix:

**test 4: direct navigation**
- tap ai tab
- verify opens unified dashboard immediately
- no intermediate page

### after ui polish:

**test 5: no misleading arrows**
- check existing features section
- verify no chevrons on items
- verify items not tappable

### after settings integration:

**test 6: toggles work**
- toggle off response suggestions
- send question message
- verify no suggestions generated
- toggle back on, verify works again
